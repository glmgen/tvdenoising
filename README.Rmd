This package provides an `R` frontend to a `C` implementation of linear-time 
univariate total variation denoising via dynamic programming (Johnson 2013).

## Installation

You can install the development version of tvdenoising from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("glmgen/tvdenoising")
```

## Example


```{r example}
library(tvdenoising)
y <- c(rnorm(30), rnorm(40, 2), rnorm(30))
yhat <- tvdenoising(y, 10)
plot(y, pch = 16)
lines(yhat, col = 2)
```
